## What is Git?
Git is version control *software*.  
- Version control software saves a history of changes, with one version of each file.  
- Every time you "commit" in git, you save a version of any files included in the commit.  
- Some of you familiar with Google Docs may have seen this in their Revision History feature.  

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a version control *service*.  

## Why use Git?
#### Version Control
The #1 reason to use Git is because it saves a history of changes in your files.
#### Compare + Restore
Git lets you compare previous versions with your current. You can go back to see where bugs or changes occurred, and restore old code or writing, while keeping the newest revisions.
#### Share
Git allows for collaboration between users. Other users can "clone" your repository, make changes, and then suggest those changes to you. Or they can be included on the project and collaborate, without risk of writing over each other.
#### Not Limited to Code
Binary-files (Word documents, model results, sound, images) can be added to Git, although you won't be able to see the changes. Nonetheless, Git still shows when the files were changed, and allows you to pull up old versions of them.
